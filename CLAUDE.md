# T2A Assistant — Claude Context

Always read `PROJECT_NOTES.md` in this folder before doing ANY work. It contains:
- Project idea + origin story (Rodrigue, neurochir Angers)
- Domain knowledge (T2A, CCAM, CIM-10, architecture codage)
- Full technical feasibility analysis
- Competition landscape
- Legal/regulatory considerations
- Architecture technique recommandée
- Next steps

Never ask Sammy to repeat information that's already in PROJECT_NOTES.md.
Update PROJECT_NOTES.md after every work session.
